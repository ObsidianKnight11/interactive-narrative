    <h1>Dark Souls</h1>
    <p>Another game I enjoyed playing was Dark Souls, specifically Dark Souls 3, with my older brother or with friends. This game tests my ability to defeat challenging bosses and deal with complex level designs while also encouraging me to have fun and feel awesome when I achieve a task that seemed impossible.</p>
